Dine With Friends
=================
Overview
--------
Dine with Friends is an app designed to faciliate making connections with your friends. This repo contains the backend code in Sinatra with Redis to store data. [Erik's has the PhoneGap app](https://github.com/erikformella/Dine-With-Friends).
Problem
-------
It can be difficult to coordinate what all your friends are up to and who wants to go to lunch at a certain time, especially in college. You don't want to look desperate mass texting everybody in your address book every day, but it takes too long to send texts in individual people and wait for them to "time out."
Solution
--------
The idea here is to just say "I'm hungry and want to eat in the next X minutes \[at LOCATION\]." DWF will let you know if any of your facebook friends also want to eat and let you set up a date.
